Day 5 and 6

Sorry, yesterday I didn't manage to write here. Milena was awake at 3 a.m. She return to sleep at 7 a.m. then My day was completely distroyed. I begin the day hoping to have energy to finish it. So, I skipped the morning routine. Actually, I've managed to pray but my focus was not there. 

As I said, yesterday was a difficult day. My manager C. needed a couple of slides, then I had MS NEO program, then there was a bunch of annoyness with Twijzel project and UC repository, then there was the meeting with MS J., then there was the introduction to Sentinel, then there was M., then C., ... then I was so distroyed that I prefer to take a bath (followed by a shower). It was TOOOO hot. 

The Azure Sentinel training was the most challenging. Milena went to sleep and I couldn't be in the room at her side anymore. I came downstairs. My in laws' were passing all the time. Then, PostNL appeared. Dog barking. Well, it was "a ramp" . Chaos! Still, I've managed to say what I've intended to the new engineers. I think, they liked!

Well, yesterday, Friday, was " patata dag." It was so warm at home. After eating we played a round of Rummikub. I won. My in laws'  returned home. Priscilla and I watched "Siners." I think we almost finished. It was 10 p.m. Yes I was supposed to stop at 9:30 p.m. to do my night routine. Well, after my routine, I went to sleep.

Today, all good. I was SUPER tired. Still, morning routine done!
