*In this post I show that although I'm late I still came here to talk to you.*

Well, today my 5:30 routine worked well. I was feeling very tired but both my Fitbit and my garmin watches showed that I am more rested then yesterday. So, all good. I was very happy to see that I'm falling asleep faster. I strongly believe this is a consequence of my night routine. The only routine that I still didn't manage to get on time is the of of writting here. I need to re-think the habit loop on that (cue->routine->reward; added to the craving). Today is my UTwente day. So, no more delays. I will focus on our IJNM submition, then read a chapter from a student, then prepare for another student. Oh my God, I forgot to review the paper of the other student. Okey. Things will be added to my agenda.

See you tomorrow.
